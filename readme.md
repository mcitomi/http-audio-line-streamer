# Stream your audio line over HTTP üí´
‚ÄãH.A.L. Streamer is a simple Node.js-based application that allows you to stream an audio line (such as a virtual sound card or microphone) over HTTP or / and websocket. The project aims to provide an easy-to-use and configurable solution for streaming audio data and optional song metadata over websocket.

## üöÄ Quickstart:
- Clone this repo to your computer or download it.
- Install the required softwares and node modules.
- Configurate your server.
- Just run the src/index.js with node .
- Be happy c:

### ‚å® Keybinds:
- `[q] [escape] [C-c]` : Close the program
- `[tab]` : Select screen
- `[Up] [Down] [PageUp] [PageDown]` : Scroll the log in the selected screen

## üåê Forward a port for the http server
- What you set in the config.json file (http_port)

## üì¶ Required softwares:
- A virtual audio cable mod: Recommended: https://vb-audio.com/Cable/ (or https://vb-audio.com/Voicemeeter/)
- FFmpeg: https://ffmpeg.org/ (be available in environment variables)
- NodeJS 

### NPM modules
Use `npm install` to install all required module.  
Used modules:
- blessed
- express
- pidusage
- ws

## üîä Playback:
- Use VLC and "Open network stream" and paste your url or open your http server url in the browser and enjoy the websocket stream (if enabled in your config :)
- Your url is: http://localhost:{http_port} // for example http://localhost:8080/
- To reduce latency, set the "network-caching" setting in VLC's settings to a lower value, e.g. 200ms. (usually the websocket is faster).

## üë®‚Äçüíª Config:
Use this command to list your audio devices which able to stream:
```
ffmpeg -list_devices true -f dshow -i dummy
```

**config.json:**
```json
{
    "http_port": 8080, // The main http server port
    "stream": {
        "ws_enabled" : true,    // Enable websocket stream and webpage
        "http_enabled" : true,  // Enable the HTTP stream
        "audio_line": "CABLE Output (VB-Audio Virtual Cable)",  // Your streamable audio input line name
        "audio_api": "dshow",   // Your system audio api, Windows: dshow Linux: pulse or alsa
        "codec": "libmp3lame",  // FFmpeg audio codec (libmp3lame for mp3)
        "bitrate": 320, // Stream bitrate in kbps
        "format": "mp3" // Stream container format (different format requires different codec)
    },
    "monitoring": {
        "refresh_interval": 45, // Resource monitor update interval in seconds (May result high CPU usage)
        "enable_ffmpeg_log": true,  // Disable / Enable FFmpeg log
        "ffmpeg_log_length": 50,    // Maximum length of FFmpeg log (to save memory)
        "screen_max_scrollback": 1000,  // Screen module max scrollback size
        "use_ps_fetch": false,   // When true uses ps instead of proc files to fetch process information
        "save_main_log" : true,    // Disable / Enable to save the main "Log" screen values to a log file
        "save_ffmpeg_log" : false,   // Disable / Enable to save the "FFmpeg Log" screen values to a log file
        "save_resource_log" : false  // Disable / Enable to save resource usage to a log file
    },
    "meta_infos" : {
        "enabled" : true,   // Enable to get meta informations from frontend
        "api_url" : "http://localhost:8181/api/current",    // Your api server link (for example: https://github.com/mcitomi/spotify-song-display-api ).
        "title_path" : "item.name", // The title location inside your api (example: https://github.com/mcitomi/spotify-song-display-api/blob/main/src/types/spotifyCurrentPlaying.d.ts ).
        "author_path" : "item.artists[0].name", // Author's name location
        "album_pic_path" : "item.album.images[0].url",  // Album / song pic url location
        "refresh_interval" : 3, // The interval when the application calls the API in seconds.
        "max_history_length" : 50   // Maximum length of music history.
    }
}
```
- Make sure the metadata server configuration and paths are valid, and the API responds with a 404 status if a song doesn't play or if no new songs are found.


# üìù Changelog

- Impressive frontend update: React based web application added to play websocket stream.
- Config settings added for frontend song display.
- Song metadata broadcaster added to backend + websocket updated.

#### Plans:
- Improved synchronization between clients with buffer size.
- Volume control from another client via client code (desktop pc audio from mobile).
- Spotify / Spicetify mod integration (search bar, song request, queue).
- Display statistics in frontend: number of stream listeners, client latency and IP address, server cpu and memory load.
- Darkmode / color themes.
- Music progress bar in frontend.

### 1.4.0.
- Removed UDP multicast -> using process pipes.
- Code Refactor: FFmpeg, client counter, HTTP and WC have been placed in separate modules.
- Websocket Stream option added to reduce delay.
- A dedicated web player has been created for the websocket stream, which can be accessed by typing https://localhost:8080/, which will redirect to https://localhost:8080/webplayer/ if you open it in a browser instead of VLC. (The HTTP stream is still available through VLC at https://localhost:8080/).
- The web player: uses vanilla javascript and html, saves volume and theme settings to local storage (the plan is to create a simple react-based application for it in the future, the current one is just a test/sample)
- Removed fluent-ffmpeg module, using only native FFmpeg as child process.
